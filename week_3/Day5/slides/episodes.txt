The reality I have is the one I create myself.
----
Finding attraction on imperfections. 
----
All I do in life is for one purpose: be happy.
----
Don't be afraid to think out of the box.
----
What stops us?.Probably judgment...and fear.
----
I wish I could be infinite...
----
Why not get crazy and wild sometimes?.
----
Running out of ideas!!!!!!.
